Go to the [course GitHub organization](https://github.com/sta199-f22-1) and locate the repo titled `ae-05-YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` to get started.

This AE is due Sunday, Sep 26 at 11:59pm.

## Type coercion

-   `c(1, 1L, "C")`

```{r}
c(1, 1L, "C")
```

```{r}
1
1L
"C"
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1, 1L, "C"))
```

-   `c(1L / 0, "A")`

```{r}
c(1L / 0, "A")
```

```{r}
typeof(1L)
typeof(0)
typeof(1L/0)
typeof("A")
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1L / 0, "A"))
```

-   `c(1:3, 5)`

```{r}
c(1:3, 5)
```

```{r}
typeof(1:3)
typeof(5)
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(1:3, 5))
```

-   `c(3, "3+")`

```{r}
c(3, "3+")
```

```{r}
typeof(3)
typeof("3+")
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(3, "3+"))
```

-   `c(NA, TRUE)`

```{r}
c(NA, TRUE)
```

```{r}
typeof(NA)
typeof(TRUE)
```

```{r}
#typeof(c(NA, TRUE))
```

## Hotel bookings

```{r}
#| label: load-packages

library(tidyverse)
library(skimr)
```

```{r}

# From TidyTuesday: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/readme.md

hotels <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv")
```

Take a look at the the following visualization.
How are the months ordered?
What would be a better order?
Then, reorder the months on the x-axis (levels of `arrival_date_month`) in a way that makes more sense.
You will want to use a function from the **forcats** package, see <https://forcats.tidyverse.org/reference/index.html> for inspiration and help.

```{r}
#| label: label-me

hotels %>%
  group_by(hotel, arrival_date_month) %>%   # group by hotel type and arrival month
  summarise(mean_adr = mean(adr)) %>%       # calculate mean adr for each group
  ggplot(aes(
    x = arrival_date_month,                 # x-axis = arrival_date_month
    y = mean_adr,                           # y-axis = mean_adr calculated above
    group = hotel,                          # group lines by hotel type
    color = hotel)                          # and color by hotel type
  ) +
  geom_line() +                             # use lines to represent data
  theme_minimal() +                         # use a minimal theme
  labs(
    x = "Arrival month",                 # customize labels
    y = "Mean ADR (average daily rate)",
    title = "Comparison of resort and city hotel prices across months",
    subtitle = "Resort hotel prices soar in the summer while ciry hotel prices remain relatively constant throughout the year",
    color = "Hotel type"
  )
```

**Stretch goal:** If you finish the above task before time is up, change the y-axis label so the values are shown with dollar signs, e.g. \$80 instead of 80.
You will want to use a function from the **scales** package, see <https://scales.r-lib.org/reference/index.html> for inspiration and help.
