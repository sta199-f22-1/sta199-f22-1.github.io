What data science background does this course assume?**\\\nA - None.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**\\\nA - While statistics $\\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap.\nHence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics.\nHowever this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\\\nA - Yes.\n\n## Course FAQ\n\n**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**\\\nA - No, but many themes are shared.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - What computing language will we learn?**\\\nA - R.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q: Why not language X?**\\\nA: We can discuss that over ☕.\n\n# Software\n\n## Excel - not...\n\n![](images/01/excel.png){fig-alt=\"An Excel window with data about countries\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## R\n\n![](images/01/r.png){fig-alt=\"An R shell\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n## RStudio\n\n![](images/01/rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"An RStudio window\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n# Data science life cycle\n\n## Data science life cycle\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.001.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle\"}\n\n## Import\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.002.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with import highlighted\"}\n\n## Tidy + transform\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.003.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with tidy and transform highlighted\"}\n\n## Visualize\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.004.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with visualize highlighted\"}\n\n## Model\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.005.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with model highlighted\"}\n\n## Understand\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.006.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with understand highlighted\"}\n\n## \n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"left\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/01/google-trend-index.png){fig-align='left' width=75%}\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"right\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.006.png){fig-align='right' width=90%}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  date             season\n  <chr>            <chr> \n1 23 January 2017  winter\n2 4 March 2017     spring\n3 14 June 2017     summer\n4 1 September 2017 fall  \n5 ...              ...   \n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Communicate\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.007.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with communicate highlighted\"}\n\n## Understand + communicate\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.008.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with understand and communicate highlighted\"}\n\n## Program\n\n![](images/01/data-science-cycle/data-science-cycle.009.png){fig-alt=\"Data science life cycle, with program highlighted\"}\n\n# Let's dive in!\n\n## Application exercise\n\n::: appex\nOr more like demo for today...\n\n📋 [github.com/sta199-f22-1/ae-0-unvotes](https://github.com/sta199-f22-1/ae-0-unvotes/)\n:::\n\n# Course overview\n\n## Homepage\n\n<https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/>\n\n-   All course materials\n-   Links to Sakai, GitHub, RStudio containers, etc.\n-   Let's take a tour!\n\n## Course toolkit\n\nAll linked from the course website:\n\n-   GitHub organization: [github.com/sta199-f22-1](https://github.com/sta199-f22-1)\n-   RStudio containers: [cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers)\n-   Communication: Slack\n-   Assignment submission and feedback: Gradescope\n\n::: callout-important\nReserve an RStudio Container (titled STA 198-199) before lab on Monday!\n:::\n\n## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}\n\n-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by watching the videos and completing the readings\n-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, office hours, team meetings\n-   **Practice:** Practice applying statistical concepts and computing with application exercises during lecture, graded for completion\n-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data\n    -

I want to be a resource for you. If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, your advisors and deans are excellent resources.\n-   I (like many people) am still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.\n:::\n\n## Accessibility\n\n-   The [Student Disability Access Office (SDAO)](https://access.duke.edu/students) is available to ensure that students are able to engage with their courses and related assignments.\n\n-   I am committed to making all course materials accessible and I'm always learning how to do this better.\n    If any course component is not accessible to you in any way, please don't hesitate to let me know.\n\n# Course policies\n\n## COVID policies\n\n-   Wear a mask at all times!\n\n-   Read and follow university guidance\n\n## Late work, waivers, regrades policy\n\n-   We have policies!\n-   Read about them on the [course syllabus](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html) and refer back to them when you need it\n\n## Collaboration policy\n\n-   Only work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\n-   Homeworks must be completed individually.\n    You may **not** directly share answers / code with others, however you are welcome to discuss the problems in general and ask for advice.\n\n-   Exams must be completed individually.\n    You may **not** discuss any aspect of the exam with peers.\n    If you have questions, post as private questions on the course forum, only the teaching team will see and answer.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code policy\n\n-   We are aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web, and many tasks may have solutions posted\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source\n\n## Academic integrity\n\n> To uphold the Duke Community Standard:\n>\n> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\n>\n> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and\n>\n> -   I will act if the Standard is compromised.\n\n## Most importantly!\n\nAsk if you're not sure if something violates a policy!\n\n# Making STA 199 a success\n\n## Five tips for success\n\n1.  Complete all the preparation work before class.\n2.  Ask questions.\n3.  Do the readings and watch the videos.\n4.  Do the homework and lab.\n5.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n## Learning during a pandemic\n\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class.\nIf this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\n::: incremental\n-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.\n-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.\n:::\n\n## This week's tasks\n\n-   Get a GitHub account if you don't have one (some advice for choosing a username [here](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html#username-advice \"Happy Git with R\"))\n-   Complete the Getting to know you survey if you haven't yet done so!\n-   Read the syllabus\n\n## Midori says...\n\n[![](images/01/midori.jpeg){fig-alt=\"Picture of my cat, Midori, with a speech bubble that says \\\"Read the syllabus and make Mine happy!\\\"\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"700\"}](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/course-syllabus.html)\n\n## It's R!\n\n[https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1564376662971760642](https://twitter.com/rafamoral/status/1564376662971760642)\n",
