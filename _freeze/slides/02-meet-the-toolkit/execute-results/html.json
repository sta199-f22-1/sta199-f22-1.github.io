Complete all the preparation work before class.\n2.  Ask questions.\n3.  Do the readings and watch the videos.\n4.  Do the homework and lab.\n5.  Don't procrastinate and don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.\n\n## Learning during a pandemic\n\nI want to make sure that you learn everything you were hoping to learn from this class.\nIf this requires flexibility, please don't hesitate to ask.\n\n::: incremental\n-   You never owe me personal information about your health (mental or physical) but you're always welcome to talk to me. If I can't help, I likely know someone who can.\n-   I want you to learn lots of things from this class, but I primarily want you to stay healthy, balanced, and grounded.\n:::\n\n## Course FAQ\n\n**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**\\\nA - None.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**\\\nA - While statistics $\\ne$ data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap.\nHence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics.\nHowever this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - Will we be doing computing?**\\\nA - Yes.\n\n## Course FAQ\n\n**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**\\\nA - No, but many themes are shared.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q - What computing language will we learn?**\\\nA - R.\n\n. . .\n\n**Q: Why not language X?**\\\nA: We can discuss that over ☕.\n\n## Course toolkit {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Course operation**\n\n-   Materials: [sta199-f22-1.github.io](https://sta199-f22-1.github.io/)\n-   Submission: Gradescope\n-   Discussion: Slack\n-   Gradebook: Sakai\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n**Doing data science**\n\n-   Computing:\n    -   R\n    -   RStudio\n    -   tidyverse\n    -   Quarto\n-   Version control and collaboration:\n    -   Git\n    -   GitHub\n:::\n:::\n\n# Toolkit: Computing\n\n## Learning goals {.smaller}\n\nBy the end of the course, you will be able to...\n\n::: incremental\n-   gain insight from data\n-   gain insight from data, **reproducibly**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly, **using modern programming tools and techniques**\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **and collaboratively**, using modern programming tools and techniques\n-   gain insight from data, reproducibly **(with literate programming and version control)** and collaboratively, using modern programming tools and techniques\n:::\n\n# Reproducible data analysis\n\n## Reproducibility checklist {.smaller}\n\n::: question\nWhat does it mean for a data analysis to be \"reproducible\"?\n:::\n\n. . .\n\n**Near-term goals:**\n\n-   Are the tables and figures reproducible from the code and data?\n-   Does the code actually do what you think it does?\n-   In addition to what was done, is it clear *why* it was done?\n\n. . .\n\n**Long-term goals:**\n\n-   Can the code be used for other data?\n-   Can you extend the code to do other things?\n\n## Toolkit for reproducibility\n\n-   Scriptability $\\rightarrow$ R\n-   Literate programming (code, narrative, output in one place) $\\rightarrow$ Quarto\n-   Version control $\\rightarrow$ Git / GitHub\n\n# R and RStudio\n\n## R and RStudio {.smaller}\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/02/r-logo.png){fig-alt=\"R logo\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n-   R is an open-source statistical **programming language**\n-   R is also an environment for statistical computing and graphics\n-   It's easily extensible with *packages*\n:::\n\n::: {.column .fragment width=\"50%\"}\n![](images/02/rstudio-logo.png){fig-alt=\"RStudio logo\"}\n\n-   RStudio is a convenient interface for R called an **IDE** (integrated development environment), e.g. *\"I write R code in the RStudio IDE\"*\n-   RStudio is not a requirement for programming with R, but it's very commonly used by R programmers and data scientists\n:::\n:::\n\n## R vs. RStudio\n\n[![](images/02/r_vs_rstudio.png){fig-alt=\"On the left: a car engine.

Some of the content in there is beyond the scope of this course, but it's a good place to look for help.\n:::\n\n## Tour: Git + GitHub\n\n-   In Lab 0 next Monday!\n-   Make sure to create a GitHub account and fill out the Getting to know you survey!\n",
