If you need them to be in another format, you need to explicitly make that transformation, which you can do so within the `pivot_longer()` function.\n-   You can tweak a plot forever, but at some point the tweaks are likely not very productive. However, you should always be critical of defaults (however pretty they might be) and see if you can improve the plot to better portray your data / results / what you want to communicate.\n",
