We are going to use these data to investigate what we would of expected to pay for an Airbnb in in Asheville, NC in June 2020.\nRead in the data and answer the following questions.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nabb <- read_csv(\"data/asheville.csv\")\n\nglimpse(abb)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nRows: 50\nColumns: 1\n$ ppg <dbl> 48.00000, 40.00000, 99.00000, 13.00000, 55.00000, 75.00000, 74.000…\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Terminology\n\n-   Population parameter - What we are interested in.\n    Statistical measure that describes an entire population.\n\n-   Sample statistic (point estimate) - describes a sample.\n    A piece of information you get from a fraction of the population.\n\nUse these data and the tools we've learned in this class to come up with your best guess for what you would expect to pay (i.e. true price) for an Airbnb in Asheville, NC (June 2020).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# add code here\n```\n:::\n\n\nDo you think your guess is correct?\n\n*Not really*\n\n-   If you want to estimate a population parameter, do you prefer to report a range of values the parameter might be in, or a single value?\n\n*Range of values*\n\n-   Variability - How spread out your data are. Uncertainty.\n\nSuppose we split the class in half and ask each student their height.\nThen, we calculate the mean height of students on each side of the classroom.\nWould you expect these two means to be exactly equal, close but not equal, or wildly different?\n\n*Close, but not equal*\n\n## Why do we care?\n\n**We can quantify the variability of the sample statistics to help calculate a range of plausible values for the population parameter of interest**\n\n**Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that re samples a single data set to create many simulated samples.**\n\n# Simulation: via bootstrapping or \"resampling\" techniques (today's focus)\n\nThe term bootstrapping comes from the phrase \"pulling oneself up by one's bootstraps\", which is a metaphor for accomplishing an impossible task without any outside help\n\nImpossible task: estimating a population parameter using data from only the given sample.\n\nNote: This notion of saying something about a population parameter using only information from an observed sample is the crux of statistical inference, it is not limited to bootstrapping.\n\n## How do we do this?\n\nGoal: create a distribution of sample statistics under \"the same\" conditions.\nHow do we do this?\n\n*Demo*\n\n*- Resample with replacement from our data n (50) times* *- Calculate the new resampled mean* *- Plot it* *- Do this entire process many many times*\n\n## Confidence Interval\n\n-   What is it?\n\n*Range of plausiable values for our population parameter... just like we wanted!*\n\n### Exercise 1 - Airbnb\n\nLet's bootstrap!\n\nIt's good practice to ask yourself the following questions:\n\n-   What is my sample statistic? *76.6*\n-   How many draws do we need for our bootstrap sample? *n number of times (50)*\n\nFill in the \\*\\*\\* from the bootstrap sample code below.\n\n\n::: {.cell hash='ae-17-quantify-uncertainty_cache/html/bootstrap_ad47f1da34b929c595e2e5b3f2e40823'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(12345)\n\nboot_df <- abb |>\n  specify(response = ppg) |>\n  generate(reps = 10000, type = \"bootstrap\") |>\n  calculate(stat = \"mean\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Take a glimpse at `boot_df`.
