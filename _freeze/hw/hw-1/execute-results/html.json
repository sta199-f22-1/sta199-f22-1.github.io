Here, we `mutate()` the `duke_forest` data frame to add a new variable called `garage` which takes the value `\"Garage\"` if the text string `\"Garage\"` is detected in the `parking` variable and takes the test string `\"No garage\"` if not.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nduke_forest |>\n  mutate(garage = if_else(str_detect(parking, \"Garage\"),   \"Garage\", \"No garage\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Then, facet by `garage` and use different colors for the two facets.\n-   Choose an appropriate binwidth and decide whether a legend is needed, and turn it off if not.\n-   Include informative title and axis labels.\n-   Finally, include a brief (2-3 sentence) narrative comparing the distributions of prices of Duke Forest houses that do and don't have garages. Your narrative should touch on whether having a garage \"makes a difference\" in terms of the price of the house.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceding.\n<br>\n:::\n\n## Exercise 2\n\nIt's expected that within any given marker larger houses will be priced higher.\nIt's also expected that the age of the house will have an effect on the price.\nHowever in some markets new houses might be more expensive while in others new construction might mean \"no character\" and hence be less expensive.\nSo your family friends ask: \"In Duke Forest, do houses that are bigger and more expensive tend to be newer ones than those that are smaller and cheaper?\"\n\nOnce again, data visualization skills to the rescue!\n\n-   Create a scatter plot to exploring the relationship between `price` and `area`, conditioning for `year_built`.\n-   Use `geom_smooth()` with the argument `se = FALSE` to add a smooth curve fit to the data and color the points by `year_built`.\n-   Include informative title, axis, and legend labels.\n-   Discuss each of the following claims (1-2 sentences per claim). Your discussion should touch on specific things you observe in your plot as evidence for or against the claims.\n    -   Claim 1: Larger houses are priced higher.\n    -   Claim 2: Newer houses are priced higher.\n    -   Claim 3: Bigger and more expensive houses tend to be newer ones than smaller and cheaper ones.\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is a good time to render, commit, and push.\n\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceding.\n<br>\n:::\n\n## Data 2: BRFSS\n\n::: callout-note\nUse this dataset for Exercises 3 to 5.\n:::\n\n> The Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) is the nation's premier system of health-related telephone surveys that collect state data about U.S. residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services.\n> Established in 1984 with 15 states, BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states as well as the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories.\n> BRFSS completes more than 400,000 adult interviews each year, making it the largest continuously conducted health survey system in the world.\n>\n> Source: [cdc.gov/brfss](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/)\n\nIn the following exercises we will work with data from the 2020 BRFSS survey.\nThe originally come from [here](https://michaelminn.net/tutorials/r-brfss/), though we will work with a random sample of responses and a small number of variables from the data provided.\nThese have already been sampled for you and the dataset you'll use can be found in the `data` folder of your repo.\nIt's called `brfss.csv`.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrfss <- read_csv(\"data/brfss.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercise 3\n\n-   How many rows are in the `brfss` dataset? What does each row represent?\n-   How many columns are in the `brfss` dataset? Indicate the type of each variable.\n-   Include the code and resulting output used to support your answer.\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br> Now is a good time to render, commit, and push.\n<br><br>\n:::\n\n## Exercise 4\n\n**Do people who smoke more tend to have worse health conditions?**\n\n-   Use a segmented bar chart to visualize the relationship between smoking (`smoke_freq`) and general health (`general_health`). Decide on which variable to represent with bars and which variable to fill the color of the bars by.\n-   Pay attention to the order of the bars and, if need be, use the `fct_relevel` function to reorder the levels of the variables.\n    -   Below is sample code for releveling `general_health`. Here we first convert `general_health` to a factor (how R stores categorical data) and then order the levels from Excellent to Poor.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nbrfss |>\n  mutate(\n    general_health = as.factor(general_health),\n    general_health = fct_relevel(general_health, \"Excellent\", \"Very good\", \"Good\", \"Fair\", \"Poor\")\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n\n-   Include informative title, axis, and legend labels.\n-   Comment on the motivating question based on evidence from the visualization: Do people who smoke more tend to have worse health conditions?\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br> Now is a good time to render, commit, and push.\n<br><br>\n:::\n\n## Exercise 5\n\n**How are sleep and general health associated?**\n\n-   Create a visualization displaying the relationship between `sleep` and `general_health`.\n-   Include informative title and axis labels.\n-   Modify your plot to use a different theme than the default.\n-   Comment on the motivating question based on evidence from the visualization: How are sleep and general health associated?\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br> Now is a good time to render, commit, and push.\n<br><br>\n:::\n\n## Exercise 6\n\n(a) Fill in the blanks:\n    -   The gg in the name of the package ggplot2 stands for \\_\\_\\_.\n    -   If you map the same continuous variable to both `x` and `y` aesthetics in a scatterplot, you get a straight \\_\\_\\_ line. (Choose between \"vertical\", \"horizontal\", or \"diagonal\".)\n(b) Code style: Fix up the code style by spaces and line breaks where needed. Briefly describe your fixes. (Hint: You can refer to the [Tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/).)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(data=mpg,mapping=aes(x=drv,fill=class))+geom_bar() +scale_fill_viridis_d()\n```\n:::\n\n\n(c) Read `?facet_wrap`. What does `nrow` do? What does `ncol` do? What other options control the layout of the individual panels? Why doesn't `facet_grid()` have `nrow` and `ncol` arguments?\n\n::: render-commit-push\n<br> Render, commit, and push one last time.\n\nMake sure that you commit and push all changed documents and your Git pane is completely empty before proceding.\n<br>\n:::\n\n# Wrap up\n\n## Submission\n\n-   Go to http://www.gradescope.com and click Log in in the top right corner.\n-   Click School Credentials Duke Net ID and log in using your Net ID credentials.\n-   Click on your STA 199 course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise.
