Make a histogram to visualize the population density of counties. Set the binwidth to 10,000 and include axes labels and a title.\n    -   Describe the shape of the distribution.\n    -   Does there appear to be are any outliers? Briefly explain.\n\n::: callout-note\nFor more details and code examples for histograms [ggplot2 reference page](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/geom_histogram.html).\n:::\n\n2.  Create a scatterplot of the percentage of people with a college degree (`percollege`) versus percentage below poverty (`percbelowpoverty`) with points colored by `state`. Label the axes and legend and give the plot a title. Use the `scale_color_viridis_d()` function to apply the viridis color palette to your plot.\n\n::: callout-note\nSee [*Introduction to the viridis color maps*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) to read more about the viridis R package and see code examples.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with the commit message \"Added answer for Ex 1 -2\".\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n3.  Describe what you observe in the plot from the previous exercise.\n    In your description, include similarities and differences in the patterns across states.\n\n4.  Now, let's examine the relationship between the same two variables, using a separate plot for each state.\n    Label the axes and give the plot a title.\n    Use `geom_smooth` with the argument `se = FALSE` to add a smooth curve fit to the data.\n    Which plot do you prefer - this plot or the plot in Ex 2?\n    Briefly explain your choice.\n\n::: callout-note\n`se = FALSE` removes the confidence bands around the line.\nThese bands show the uncertainty around the smooth curve.\nWe'll discuss uncertainty around estimates later in the course and bring these bands back then.\n:::\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\n\nOnce again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n5.  *Do some states have counties that tend to be geographically larger than others?* To explore this question, create side-by-side boxplots of area (`area`) of a county based on state (`state`).\n    -   Describe what you observe from the plot.\n    -   Which state has the single largest county? How do you know based on the plot?\n6.  *Do some states have a higher percentage of their counties located in a metropolitan area?* Create a segmented bar chart with one bar per state and the fill determined by the distribution of `metro`, whether a county is considered in a metro area. The y axis of the segmented barplot should range from 0 to 1.\n    -   What do you notice from the plot?\n\n::: callout-note\nFor this exercise, you should begin with the data wrangling code below.\nWe will learn more about data wrangling next week.\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmidwest <- midwest |>\n  mutate(metro = if_else(inmetro == 1, \"Yes\", \"No\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: render-commit-push\nNow is another good time to render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\n\nAnd once again, make sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\nWe keep repeating this because it's important, and because we see students forget to do this.\nSo take a moment to make sure you're following along with the instructions around Git.\n:::\n\n7.  Recreate the plot below.\n\nHints:\n\n-   [The `ggplot2` reference for themes](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/ggtheme.html) will be helpful in determining the theme.\n-   The `size` of the points is 2.\n-   The transparency (`alhpa`) of the points is 0.5.\n-   You can put line breaks in labels with `\\n`.\n\n![](images/lab-1/ex-7.png)\n\n::: render-commit-push\nRender, commit, and push your final changes to GitHub with a meaningful commit message.\n\nMake sure to commit and push all changed files so that your Git pane is empty afterwards.\n:::\n\n# Submission\n\nOnce you are finished with the lab, you will your final PDF document to Gradescope.\n\n::: callout-warning\nBefore you wrap up the assignment, make sure all documents are updated on your GitHub repo.\nWe will be checking these to make sure you have been practicing how to commit and push changes.\n\nYou must turn in a PDF file to the Gradescope page by the submission deadline to be considered \"on time\".\n:::\n\nTo submit your assignment:\n\n-   Go to <http://www.gradescope.com> and click *Log in* in the top right corner.\n-   Click *School Credentials* $\\rightarrow$ *Duke NetID* and log in using your NetID credentials.\n-   Click on your *STA 199* course.\n-   Click on the assignment, and you'll be prompted to submit it.\n-   Mark all the pages associated with exercise. All the pages of your lab should be associated with at least one question (i.e., should be \"checked\").\n-   Select the first page of your .pdf submission to be associated with the *\"Workflow & formatting\"* question.\n\n# Grading (50 pts)\n\n| Component             | Points |\n|:----------------------|:-------|\n| Ex 1                  | 4      |\n| Ex 2                  | 6      |\n| Ex 3                  | 4      |\n| Ex 4                  | 8      |\n| Ex 5                  | 6      |\n| Ex 6                  | 6      |\n| Ex 7                  | 8      |\n| Workflow & formatting | 8      |\n\n::: callout-note\nThe \"Workflow & formatting\" grade is to assess the reproducible workflow.\nThis includes having at least 3 informative commit messages, labeling the code chunks, and having readable code that does not exceed 80 characters, i.e., we can read all your code in the rendered PDF.\n:::\n",
