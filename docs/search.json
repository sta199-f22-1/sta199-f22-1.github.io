It is possible (and quite likely) that the true slope of the relationship between durations and top speeds of all roller coasters is not exactly equal to this value. How can we quantify the uncertainty around this estimate?\n\nUse a confidence interval.\n\nYour turn: Describe how we can construct a bootstrap distribution for the slope of the model predicting top_speed from duration.\n\nTake a bootstrap sample of pairs of top_speed and duration.\nFit a model predicting top_speed from duration using the bootstrap sample and record the value of the slope.\nRepeat steps 1 and 2 many times.\n\nDemo: Now, construct this bootstrap distribution.\n\n\nset.seed(12345)\n\nboot_df_slope <- rc |>\n  specify(top_speed ~ duration) |>\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |>\n  calculate(stat = \"slope\")\n\nWarning: Removed 34 rows containing missing values.\n\n\n\nDemo: Create a 90% confidence interval by filling in the code below.\n\n\nboot_df_slope |>\n  summarize(\n    lower = quantile(stat, 0.05),\n    upper = quantile(stat, 0.95)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n    lower upper\n    <dbl> <dbl>\n1 -0.0195 0.132\n\n\n\nDemo: Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the problem.\n\nWe are 90% confident that, for each additional second the ride is longer, the predicted top speed of the roller coaster is lower by -0.0195 to higher by 0.132 miles per hour, on average.\n\nDemo: Now fit a model predicting log of top_speed from duration.\n\n\nrc <- rc |>\n  mutate(top_speed_log = log(top_speed))\n\nspeed_log_fit <- linear_reg() |>\n  fit(top_speed_log ~ duration, data = rc) \n\ntidy(speed_log_fit)\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 5\n  term        estimate std.error statistic  p.value\n  <chr>          <dbl>     <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>\n1 (Intercept)  3.92     0.0686       57.1  2.15e-89\n2 duration     0.00104  0.000514      2.03 4.48e- 2\n\n\n\nDemo: Write the estimated model and interpret the slope.\n\n\\(\\widehat{log(top~speed)} = 3.92 + 0.00104 \\times duration\\)\nRecall that to interpret the slope value we need to exponentiate it!\nWhy?\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nlog(y~for~x + 1) - log(y~for~x) &= \\beta_1 \\\\\nlog\\Big(\\frac{y~for~x + 1}{y~for~x}\\Big) &= \\beta_1 \\\\\ne^{log\\Big(\\frac{y~for~x + 1}{y~for~x}\\Big)} &= e^\\beta_1 \\\\\n\\frac{y~for~x + 1}{y~for~x} &= e^\\beta_1\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThis implies that our explanatory variable has a multiplicative relationship with our response variable.\nFor each additional second the ride is longer, the predicted top speed of the roller coaster is higher by a factor of \\(e^0.00104 = 1.001\\), on average.\n\n\nResearch question 3\n\nWe are also interested in investigating if roller coasters opened after 1970 are faster than those opened before. For this question, we want to estimate the difference.\n\n\nQuestion: How is this different from question one? Should we make a confidence interval or conduct a hypothesis test?\n\nWe are interested in estimating the difference. This suggests we should make a confidence interval.\n\nDemo: Now, use bootstrapping to estimate the difference between the true speeds of roller coasters before and after 1970.\n\n\nset.seed(12345)\n\nboot_df <- rc |>\n  specify(top_speed ~ opened_recently) |>\n  generate(reps = 1000, type = \"bootstrap\") |>\n  calculate(stat = \"diff in means\", order = c(\"yes\", \"no\"))\n\nWarning: Removed 11 rows containing missing values.\n\n\n\nYour turn: Create a 99% confidence interval and interpret it in the context of the data and the research question.\n\n\nboot_df |>\n  summarize(\n    lower = quantile(stat, 0.005),\n    upper = quantile(stat, 0.995)\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 2\n  lower upper\n  <dbl> <dbl>\n1  8.88  23.3\n\n\nWe are 99% confident that the true mean speed between roller coasters after 1970 are 8.88 to 23.3 mph higher than the true mean speed for roller coasters before 1970.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nBrainstorm the differences between generating new samples via bootstrapping and permuting. Write down the key differences below. Hint: Think back to the different sampling techniques between research question 1 and research questions 2 and 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nRoller Coaster DataBase, UltimateRollerCoaster.com, ESTEEM: Enhancing Statistics Teachers Education with E-Modules.↩︎"

BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.\n\n\nHave you used a natural language model before? Describe your use.\n\nAdd your response here.\n\nWhat is meant by “stochastic parrots” in the paper title?\n\nAdd your response here.\n\n\nPart 2 - Predicting ethnicity\nYour turn (12 minutes): Imai and Khanna (2016) built a racial prediction algorithm using a Bayes classifier trained on voter registration records from Florida and the U.S. Census Bureau’s name list.\n\nThe following is the title and the abstract of the paper. Take a minute to read them.\n\n\nImproving Ecological Inference by Predicting Individual Ethnicity from Voter Registration Record (Imran and Khan, 2016)\n\n\nIn both political behavior research and voting rights litigation, turnout and vote choice for different racial groups are often inferred using aggregate election results and racial composition. Over the past several decades, many statistical methods have been proposed to address this ecological inference problem. We propose an alternative method to reduce aggregation bias by predicting individual-level ethnicity from voter registration records. Building on the existing methodological literature, we use Bayes’s rule to combine the Census Bureau’s Surname List with various information from geocoded voter registration records. We evaluate the performance of the proposed methodology using approximately nine million voter registration records from Florida, where self-reported ethnicity is available. We find that it is possible to reduce the false positive rate among Black and Latino voters to 6% and 3%, respectively, while maintaining the true positive rate above 80%. Moreover, we use our predictions to estimate turnout by race and find that our estimates yields substantially less amounts of bias and root mean squared error than standard ecological inference estimates. We provide open-source software to implement the proposed methodology. The open-source software is available for implementing the proposed methodology.\n\nThe said “source software” is the wru package: https://github.com/kosukeimai/wru.\n\nThen, if you feel comfortable, load the wru package and try it out using the sample data provided in the package.

It includes characteristics of all flights departing from New York City (JFK, LGA, EWR) in 2013.\nThe data frame has over 336,000 observations (rows), 336776 observations to be exact, so we will not view the entire data frame.

    "text": "Questions from last time 2\n\nWhat is the difference between rendering and saving a document?\n\nWhen you edit your Quarto file and you save it, your changes are saved but they’re not reflected in your output HTML or PDF file. When you render the document, the output is also updated to reflect those changes. When you hit render, RStudio automatically first saves your Quarto file, and then renders it. So I recommend you render early and often, both to save your changes, and also to make sure your changes did not introduce any errors into the document.\n\n\nWhat does it mean to commit and push something?\n\nWe “commit” to take a snapshot of the files in our local repository, i.e. the files that are saved on the university servers you’re using. We “push” to get those changes to the remote repository, i.e. your repository on GitHub."

    "text": "Can I use a local install of R and RStudio instead of using the RStudio containers?\nThe short answer is, I’d rather you didn’t, to save yourself some headache. But, the long answer is, sure! But you will need to install a specific versions of R and RStudio for everything to work as expected. You will also need to install the R packages we’re using as well as have Git installed on your computer. These are not extremely challenging things to get right, but they are not trivial either, particularly on certain operating systems. Myself and the TAs are always happy to provide help with any computational questions when you’re working in the containers we have provided for you. If you’re working on your local setup, we can’t guarantee being able to resolve your issues, though we’re happy to try.\nIf you want to take this path, here is what you need to do:\n\nDownload and install R 4.2.1: https://cran.r-project.org/\nDownload and install the preview build of RStudio: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview/\nInstall Git: https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html\nInstall any necessary packages with install.packages(\"___\")\n\nAnd I’d like to reiterate again that successful installation of these software is not a learning goal of this course. So if any of this seems tedious or intimidating in any way, just use the computing environment we have set up for you. More on that here."

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

    "text": "Activities & Assessment\nThe activities and assessments in this course are designed to help you successfully achieve the course learning objectives. They are designed to follow the Prepare, Practice, Perform format.\n\nPrepare: Includes short videos, reading assignments, and lectures to introduce new concepts and ensure a basic comprehension of the material. The goal is to help you prepare for the in-class activities during lecture.\nPractice: Includes in-class application exercises where you will begin to the concepts and methods introduced in the prepare assignment. the activities will graded for completion, as they are designed for you to gain experience with the statistical and computing techniques before working on graded assignments.\nPerform: Includes labs, homework, exams, and the project. These assignments build upon the prepare and practice assignments and are the opportunity for you to demonstrate your understanding of the course material and how it is applied to analyze real-world data.\n\n\nLectures (Prepare)\nPart of the class time will be lectures that introduce new concepts or review topics from the preparation videos. Lectures will not repeat everything in the videos, they will instead highlight important and known to be complex concepts and will be supplemented with live coding activities. You are expected to attend every lecture. Lectures will be recorded and made available to students with an excused absence upon request.\n\n\nApplication exercises (Practice)\nA majority of the in-class lectures will be dedicated to working on Application Exercises (AEs). These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the prepare assignment. These AEs are due within three days of the corresponding lecture period. Specifically, AEs from Tuesday lectures are due Friday by 11:59p ET, and AEs from Thursday lectures are due Sunday by 11:59p ET.\nBecause these AEs are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\nIn addition to AEs will be periodic activities help build a learning community. These will be short, fun activities that will help everyone in the class connect throughout the semester.\n\n\nLabs (Perform)\nIn labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios, with a focus on the computation. Most lab assignments will be completed in teams, and all team members are expected to contribute equally to the completion of each assignment. You are expected to use the team’s Git repository on the course’s GitHub page as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nLabs are due 11:59p ET on the indicated due date.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework (Perform)\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nHomework assignments are due 11:59p ET on the indicated due date.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nExams (Perform)\nThere will be two, take-home, open-note exams. Through these exams you have the opportunity to demonstrate what you’ve learned in the course thus far. Each exam will include small analysis and computational tasks related to the content in the prepare, practice, and perform assignments. More details about the content and structure of the exams will be discussed during the semester.\n\n\nProject (Perform)\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic honesty\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nPlease abide by the following as you work on assignments in this course:\n\nYou may discuss individual homework and lab assignments with other students; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with other students. For team assignments, you may collaborate freely within your team. You may discuss the assignment with other teams; however, you may not directly share (or copy) code or write up with another team. Unauthorized sharing (or copying) of the code or write up will be considered a violation for all students involved.\nYou may not discuss or otherwise work with others on the exams. Unauthorized collaboration or using unauthorized materials will be considered a violation for all students involved. More details will be given closer to the exam date.\nReusing code: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, you may make use of online resources (e.g. StackOverflow) for coding examples on assignments. If you directly use code from an outside source (or use it as inspiration), you must explicitly cite where you obtained the code. Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism.\n\nAny violations in academic honesty standards as outlined in the Duke Community Standard and those specific to this course will automatically result in a 0 for the assignment and will be reported to the Office of Student Conduct for further action.\n\n\nLate work & extensions\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\n\nLate work\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email the head TA before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade requests\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the project presentations.\n\n\nClass recording requests\nLectures will be recorded on Panopto and will be made available to students with an excused absence upon request. Videos shared with such students will be available for a week. To request a particular lecture’s video, please fill out the form. Please also make sure that any official documentation, such as incapacitation forms, Dean’s excuses, NOVAPs, and quarantine/removal from class notices from student health are also uploaded to the form.\n\n\nAttendance policy\n\nCOVID Symptoms, Exposure, or Infection: Student health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have tested positive for COVID-19 or have possible symptoms and have not yet been tested. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health (dshcheckin@duke.edu, 919-681-9355). Learn more about current university policy related to COVID-19 at https://coronavirus.duke.edu. To keep the university community’s safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\nInclement weather: In the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work.  Asynchronous catch-up methods may apply.\nReligious accommodations: Students are permitted by university policy to be absent from class to observe a religious holiday. Accordingly, Trinity College of Arts & Sciences and the Pratt School of Engineering have established procedures to be followed by students for notifying their instructors of an absence necessitated by the observance of a religious holiday. Please submit requests for religious accommodations at the beginning of the semester so that we can work to make suitable arrangements well ahead of time. You can find the policy and relevant notification form here: https://trinity.duke.edu/undergraduate/academic-policies/religious-holidays.\n\nNote: If you’ve read this far in the syllabus, email me a picture of your pet if you have one or your favourite meme!"
