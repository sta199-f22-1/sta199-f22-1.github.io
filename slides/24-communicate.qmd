## Project

-   Review peer evaluations left by your peers, implement updates as you see fit, close the issue once you review them.

-   Have a clear plan for who is doing what, open issues on your repo, and assign them to individuals who can then close the issues as they finish a task.

-   Schedule at least one team meting between today and your presentation to practice your presentation together.

## Recap {.smaller}

::: incremental
-   Represent percentages as parts of a whole
-   Place variables representing time on the x-axis when possible
-   Pay attention to data types, e.g., represent time as time on a continuous scale, not years as levels of a categorical variable
-   Prefer direct labeling over legends
-   Use accessible colors
-   Use color to draw attention
-   Pick a purpose and label, color, annotate for that purpose
-   Communicate your main message directly in the plot labels
-   Simplify before you call it done (a.k.a. "Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and take one thing off")
