# Warm up

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
```

## While you wait for class to begin...

::: nonincremental
-   Clone your `ae-03` repo.
-   Any questions from prepare materials? Go to [slido.com](https://www.slido.com/) / #sta199. You can also upvote others' questions.

## Announcements

-   Request videos for missed classes via the **video request form**
-   Ask course questions **on Slack**
    -   Using code formatting and proper indentation

    -   Taking screenshots

    -   Checking for previous questions

## Questions from last time

-   How come I had to **load** my packages each session before basic functions like `ggplot()` become available?
-   Will we spend time learning more of the actual fundamental statistics needed to understand how the different graphs work and which ones are most useful for different data sets?

## Coding style + workflow

::: incremental
-   Avoid long lines of code.

    -   We should be able to see [all]{.underline} of your code in the PDF document you submit.

-   Label code chunks.

    -   Do **not** put spaces in the code-chunk `label`s.

-   Render, commit, and push regularly.

    -   Think about it like clicking to save regularly as you type a report.

# Application exercise

## `ae-03`

::: appex
-   Go to the course [GitHub org](https://github.com/sta199-f22-1) and find your `ae-03` (repo name will be suffixed with your GitHub name).
-   Clone the repo in your container, open the Quarto document in the repo, and follow along and complete the exercises.
-   Render, commit, and push your edits by the AE deadline (3 days from today).

## Recap of AE {.smaller}

-   The pipe operator, `|>`, can be read as "and then".
-   The pipe operator passes what comes before it into the function that comes after it as the first argument in that function.

```{r}
sum(1, 2)
1 |> 
  sum(2)
```

-   Always use a line break after the pipe, and indent the next line of code.
    -   Just like always use a line break between layers of ggplots, after `+`, and indent the next line.
