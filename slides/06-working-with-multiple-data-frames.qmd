# Warm up

```{r}
#| echo: false

library(countdown)
```

## While you wait for class to begin...

-   Open your `ae-03` project in RStudio (that you already started on Tuesday), render your document, and commit and push.
-   Any questions from prepare materials? Go to [slido.com](https://www.slido.com/) / #sta199. You can also upvote others' questions.

## Announcements {.smaller}

-   Recap: Asking code related questions on Slack
    -   Ideally: Code formatted text, not screenshots
    -   If need be: Screenshots, not photos of screens
    -   Always include code along with the error
-   Troubleshooting 101: Read your error messages in full, out loud if need be
-   Code formatting 101:
    -   Always line breaks after `+` and `|>`

    -   Add line breaks as needed after `,` to help fit code on rendered PDF

    -   Think poetry (short lines), not novellas (long sentences)

## `ae-03`

Continue work from Tuesday...

## Joining datasets

::: question
Describe a scenario where two datasets that contain information about students from this class may need to be joined.
What might the analysis be about?
What column (information) could be used to join the datasets?
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false

countdown(minutes = 3)
```

# Application exercise

## Goal

Join data from multiple data frames, summarize it, and create this plot.
